                android:text="A brilliant architectural beauty is a historical fort in Delhi, Red Fort which was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty for more than 200 years. The Mughal families lived there until 1857. A golden feather in the crown of Delhi is the fort and it houses several museums in it. Though it was the house of the Mughal emperors, it was also the political and cultural center of the Mughal state and this was the place where a lot of significant events happened. It is the best place to visit in Old Delhi as it is also known to be a symbol of India's struggle for freedom. But what made the fort famous was the midnight speech made by Jawahar Lal Nehru before India was going to wake up to independence from British rule and afterward, it was becoming the politically significant spot in Indian history. It hosts the Independence Day celebrations each year from then onward. Red Fort history has a lot to share with the world and it came into the concept form in 1639 after the then Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan shifted his capital to the newly constructed city in Delhi and laid the foundation stone to build up the fort. Red Fort architecture is an amusing one with a huge walled citadel that shines in red sandstone and the construction of the fort took almost one decade to complete and it came into the limelight in 1648. For the next 200 years, it was maintained as the seat of the Mughal Empire. Once the capital of the Mughal Empire, the fort lies along the famous river Yamuna. Some of the facts regarding the fort say the complex consist of Shah Jahan’s palace as well as the Salimgarh fort which came into existence in 1546 AD. The fort is managed by the Archeological Survey of India and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007."

Qutub Minar’s founder was the legendary Qutub al-Din Aibak who was behind the existence of the Delhi Sultanate. The construction of the structure was started in 1192 and it was completed by Aibak’s successor Iltumish in 1220. But after some decades, its top storey was destructed by a lightning and later Firoz Shah Tughlaq renovated the damaged storey and constructed one more. Around the tower, there are several historical monuments like the Qutub Complex with Quwwat ul IslaMosqueue and the Iron Pillar of Delhi. The structure of the tower has a style that resembles the architectural style prevailed in Iran but some artistic conventions found locally were incorporated such as looped bells, garlands and lotuses that are borders were carved out. One can see different inscriptions in Parso-Arabic and Nagari at different sections of the structure."

It is the tomb of the famous Mughal emperor of India Humayun. It was commissioned by the first wife of Humayun who was the chief consort as well, Empress Bega Begum in 1569-70. The design of the tomb was born in the heart of Mirak Mirza Ghiyas- a persial architect invited by Bega Begum herself. Located in Nizamuddin East in Delhi, the tomb is known as the first garden tomb found on the Indian subcontinent, placed very close to the Dina-panah citadel. It is known to be one of the best places to visit in Delhi during summers as it also has a walled garden within its enclosure. UNESCO declared it as a World Heritage Site in 1993 and since then its reputation began to flourish. But after that, it had to undergo several restorations. Near the tomb, there are several smaller monuments from the main entrance to the West that include one that even built prior to the main tomb. Isa Khan Niyazi’s tomb is that one who was an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri’s court of the Suri dynasty. Humayun’s tomb complex accommodates the main tomb of the Emperor Humayun along with the graves of Bega Begum, Hamida Begum and Dara Shikoh as well as other significant Mughal members. An inimitable leap in Mughal architecture is displayed along with the Persian model garden that is the Charbagh garden. The construction of the toms was started in 1565, almost nine years after his death. The completion of the tomb was in 1572. The memorial built for Humayun symbolizes the unpredictable symbiosis between Humayun and his wife Bega Begum who was so grieved over the death of her husband finally decided to create such an astonishing remembrance. The Turkic and Mughal rule in the subcontinent introduced the influence of Central Asian and Persian styles of Islamic architecture and from the 12th century onward, those styles started inspiring several monuments in and around Delhi. Humayun’s tomb is made of red sandstone and white marbles and the measurements say it is 47 meters high and 91 meters wide."

The famous British architect Edwin Landseer Lutyens was given the responsibility for the primary architecture. The design made by Lutyens was grand and extraordinarily classical that was enhanced by different colours and details inspired by Indian architecture. Originally, the Viceroy’s House had to be built on the top of Raisina Hill along with the secretariats lower down. But it was decided to build 400 yards back and thus both the buildings had to come on top of the plateau. On this, Lutyens and Baker who was constructing the secretariat had disputes. The house consists of four floors and 340 rooms which are decorated with modified interior designs. There were around 700 million bricks used for the construction.

At Delhi Jantar Mantar, there are 13 architectural astronomy instruments. It is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi in summers and it was designed in order to compile the astronomical tables and to predict the movement and timings of the sun, the moon and the planets. Situated on the Parliament Street, south of Connaught Circus in New Delhi, the Observatory possesses masonry built astronomical instruments. Due to the unlimited desire of Maharaja Jai Singh II to spend time in the astronomical observations and to study the systems, the observatory was erected by himself. The name of the observatory gives us a meaning that is the instrument for calculation. The instruments preserved in the observatory were made of brick rubbles and then plastered with lime. As the time progressed, the instruments had undergone several repairs and restoration. But major alterations were far from them. The Samrat Yantra, the Jai Prakash, Ram Yantra, and Misra Yantra are the principal instruments preserved in the observatory. A temple dedicated to Bhairava is also near the building which was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II. The Jantar Mantar in Delhi had its construction started in 1724. It came into existence in 1724 but by 1867, the observatory had faced a considerable amount of decays. After the construction of the Jantar Mantar in Delhi, Maharaja Jai Singh II had built more observatories in Jaipur, Ujjain, Varanasi, and Mathura."
