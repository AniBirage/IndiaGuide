Fringed by strip of mangroves overlooking the beach, the luxury resort in Andaman is a homage to the secluded Andaman and Nicobar archipelago stretching for 700 Kms from the southern tip of Burma towards the north of Sumatra; a magical medley of rainforests, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, unspoilt beaches and ancient tribal cultures. After arriving on the island, guests are welcomed with a traditional song by our young Nicobari colleagues. Designed to showcase and nurture the island’s natural resources, the our luxury beach resort in Andaman is dotted with 72 modern luxury Villas on stilts under a canopy of Coconut and Palmyra trees; a contemporary haven built without cutting off a single tree. Guests can rest over the massive buttresses of an Andaman Padauk tree, ruminate by the water lily pond after a lavish massage or hit the treadmill at the fitness centre built around a majestic Mahua tree that soars up one level to the Olympic-length infinity swimming pool. The modish, 147 sq. mts. plus residences in sustainable plantation timber are inspired by the dwellings of the Jarawa tribe. Wi-fi internet at the lobby ensures connectivity, while our silent and intuitive service creates a bespoke atmosphere for privacy and romance interrupted only the sound of kingfishers and emerald doves. Taj’s commitment to conservation and sustainable luxury in the archipelago is at the core of the resort’s impeccable facilities and services. Along with our own biogas facility, water bottling plant, a reservoir for rainwater harvesting and partial solar energy, we’ve partnered with the Pollution Control Board to keep the island plastic free while developing a plastic collection centre on the mainland. From biodegradable straws and paper to newer tools developed in training sessions with our associates and the islanders, we’re working consistently on reducing carbon footprint on this paradise. The beach resort in Havelock Island offers a bouquet of fun activities for children that engage them in the marine and terrestrial ecology of the island. Between picking mangoes, mud apples and mulberries at our bountiful orchards to jungle treks, beach picnics, supervised scuba diving and shell-craft lessons at our vibrant Recreational Center with plenty of post-meal snoozes on villa decks, there isn’t a dull moment for young and curious minds. The island is an endless source of delight and discovery. Unravel the secrets of the outdoors and underwater life with exclusive experiences in Sport Fishing, Night Kayaking in the mangroves, Scuba Diving, Snorkelling and Forest Treks."

                android:text="The Big Tree Resort is a boutique 8 room property nestled in an organic farm &amp; a reserve forest, fringed by the ocean, in Chidiyatapu, Andaman Islands. From its inception, this resort has been a labour of love. Love for the beautiful islands we call home, for the waters that surround us, for the trees that shelter us. It is our long history and relationship with Chidiyatapu that led us to build The Big Tree Resort, so we could better share our slice of paradise with like minded people from around the world. The charm of Big Tree is its simplicity – the village vibes, the reserve forest that keeps the urban sprawl at bay, the warmth of the farmers, fishermen &amp; sailors that are our neighbours &amp; the simple arcadian rhythm that governs the days &amp; nights of everyone that lives here. The rooster rouses the sun, who in turn wakes us. The moon plays with the sea, creating the high tides for us to go dive &amp; snorkel, &amp; then the lows that allow us to walk through the ephemeral intertidals. As the sun dips into the sea each evening, the sky lights up dramatically in pink and orange and the birds come home to roost. As the moon rises from behind the trees the Andaman Scops Owl emerges and cat eyes glow. At the Big Tree Resort we have tried to create a space where natural rhythms rule our days. We rise with the sun, plan our days with the sea, let loose when the mad moon rises and get tipsy under the starlight. Our rooms are designed to blend in with the trees around, our balconies open into the canopy, you can birdwatch as you bathe."
